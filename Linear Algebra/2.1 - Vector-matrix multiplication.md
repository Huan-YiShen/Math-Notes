Mathematic definition of vector-matrix multiplication
- somewhat mechanical computation procedure
- note that the mechanical / repetitive nature is a feature and not a bug, allows for summation of larger ideas and automation via computers

2 ways of interpretating vector-matrix multiplication
1. Dot products 
	- view the resulting vector as dot products of (each matrix row)(input vector)
	- split the matrix via rows, each 
	- matrix in indices form
1. System of equations (view each row of the matrix as a linear equation)


This idea can be extended to [[2.2 - Matrix-matrix multiplication]]
