This is one of the core concepts in Linear Algebra. This is where the "linearity" of linear algebra came from.

**Linear Combination** involves two concepts
- scalar Multiplication
- Vector Addition
For instance: a linear combination of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ can be written as 
$c\vec{a}+d\vec{b}$
more formally, the mathematical object must be closed under scalar multiplication and the addition operator.

In the fields of Physics and Engineering this concept is sometimes called [[Superposition]]
- For example, Quantum Mechanics is a Linear theory, it's linearity came from the fact that the wavefunction can perform linear combination
- For linear theories, if $A$ is a solution to an equation, then the linear combination of $A$ is also a solution of that equation.
- $A$ can be a variable (solution of an equation), but also a function (solution of a differential equation)

Concepts leads to
notion of [[linear independence]]
